After about a week of implementation I have added several new features to the
website. One feature that was added recently was the about page. Everything that
is inside the about page is now relevant to the entire website. I also have deleted
unnecessary links on the footer. Although my website doesn't display it yet, I have
been working on the country list for the website and have added and tested some
new features. I am still getting use to using JavaScript with the markdown files.

In the following week I plan to remove all the unnecessary items that do not go
along with the theme of my website. I also plan to update all the links that
are listed on the site. Another feature I plan to keep working on is the country
list. This is a tedious part and is the focal point for the whole site. I have
managed to get an version of the code to work but now I need to convert it to
markdown. This has been quite a challenge for me, and I definitely underestimated
the time it was going to take.
