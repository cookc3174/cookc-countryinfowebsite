## Update one

After the past two weeks I have been able to get most of my web site completed.
Firstly, I have removed all the unnecessary images and pieces of text that were
present on each web page. I also have updated the home page of my site so that
it goes along more with the theme of the entire website. Another part that I
have been working on for about a month now is the country list. At first I was
having complications when it came to getting my site to read a markdown file for
each country. Eventually, I managed to get the list of countries to print out and
display all the intended content.

My next step is to complete the country list and have all the information for each
of them be displayed. This is going to be a simple but time consuming process because
there are so many countries that I have to work with. The last part I want to complete
on my website is the blog page. Although I have a completed and fully functional blog
page, I still need to make the content it is displaying relevant to my website.
