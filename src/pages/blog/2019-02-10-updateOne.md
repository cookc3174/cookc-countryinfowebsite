## Update one

After being first assigned the web design portfolio I have implemented a few
new features. One of the first features that I added was simply a new logo. I
felt like I needed something to re brand the website as a whole. Another implementation
that I made was changing the layout of the navigation bar. Even though I was working
with a template from Netlify, I still had to familiarize myself with how the website
was implemented as a whole. I changed one of the navigation tabs to "Country List".
This is where all the country information will be held.

While I was working on my web design portfolio I thought of several features that
I want to add. The next implementation I want to make on my website is adding
all the country information. I want to design this in a way that is appealing to
a user. I feel the hard part for this part is going to be getting the actual
information for all the different countries. Another feature I want to add is
a better CSS layout. Even thought I like the way the website is  laid out now
I feel like I still need to change a few things around to make the website go
better with my initial theme. One of the main parts of the website that need to
be changed is the pictures and the colors.
