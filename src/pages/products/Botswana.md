## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Botswana has one of the oldest cultures on Earth: the Bushman. Botswana Bushmen are still practicing hunter-gatherers since early times; they are the indigenous population of South Africa. A visit to the safari has to include interaction with the indigenous: the San people to see how the cave dwellers might have lived. The Basarwa has rock art scattered around South Africa and adventurers can experience life as a forgoer.

###2
The Okavango Delta is home to wildlife native to Kalahari Dessert, based in the centre of the dessert, the Okavango River allows a canoe to be paddled through for the adventurer to witness the diversity of life of South Africa. The Okavango Delta is an oasis where the river empties into the swamp rather than the sea. Every rainy season the delta swells upto three times it original size to support all live that depends on it. There are three more wild life parks and seven more game reserves in Botswana.

Botswana's government owns one of the largest diamond mining companies in the world. De Beers company had joined with the Botswanian government to operate Debswana, the company that owns all of Botswana's diamond mines. Botswana's main economy is fueled mainly by diamonds and other ores, with tourism and argiculture trailing close behind. Due to fears that diamonds will dry out in Botswana in the future, the government is trying to shift the economy to tourism, agriculture and trade.
