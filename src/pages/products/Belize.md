## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Perhaps Belize is best known for the Belize Barrier Reef, located off of the country's coast. The Reef is massive, second in size only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Because of the Reef's great size, there are over 200 islands of varied sizes just off the Belize coast, many of which are not populated.

###2
Belize is home to over 900 known Mayan historical and archaeological sites. The Mayan civilization was one of the largest and most powerful Native American groups to occupy South America. Their unique and striking art and architecture have drawn awe from many.

###3
Largely because of protective acts, a great deal of the natural forests in Belize have remained untouched and today retain their unique diversity. In Belize forests range from the thick, tropical variety to, in fact, the only pine tree forest in South America. Because these areas have remained undisturbed a great deal of natural wildlife continues to inhabit the country.

###4
Standing apart from the rest of the Central and South American countries, the national language of Belize is English. This has lead to Belize becoming a popular destination for English-speaking tourists and expatriates. But English is not the only language in use in Belize ' it is not uncommon to hear Creole and Spanish as well, among others.

###5
Belize is home to the first endangered jaguar preserve in the world, the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. Established in the 1980s, the sanctuary covers an area of almost 150 square miles in the southern region. There are even parks within the preserve which people are welcome to visit and observe the wide variety of flora and fauna including nearly 300 different species of birds.
