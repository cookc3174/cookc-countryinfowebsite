## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Bermuda is divided into nine parishes, they are: Devonshire, Hamilton, Paget, Pembroke, St George's, Sandy's, Smith's, Southampton and Warwick. These parishes are known to some as counties in other areas. Each of these parishes also has individual towns or neighborhoods within them.

###2
Most people come to Bermuda for the beach, which is no secret; however few know that the sand is actually a pink color. The vibrant blue waters and coral colored sand actually are the biggest attraction on the island. Many people enjoy scuba and snorkeling. There are also many ship wrecked sights that tourists who are into scuba love to explore. If one is into water sports, Bermuda is the place to visit.

###3
The locals in Bermuda actually celebrate many holidays like the American's. In fact they celebrate Easter, Christmas and even Labor Day. However, the customs observed are slightly different. For instance, the locals celebrate Easter, but they do it by flying handmade kites to celebrate the day.

###4
Though there are 150 islands that make up Bermuda, only 20 of them have people living on them. This is partly because the Bermudians believe that the islands are haunted. On the main island of Bermuda, over 20 documented cases of people vanishing from the beaches without a trace left of them. An old legend says that there is a ghost knapper that haunts the beaches, while it may seem like silly superstitions, the Bermudians wholeheartedly believe in it.

###5
In a land that is surrounded by water, it seems odd that there are no rivers, streams or fresh waters supplies available. Because of the scarce nature of the water, Bermudians must rely on rain water to replenish their water systems. Due to the fact that they depend on rain water, at times they may be in a water crisis. Rain water harvesting is a smart resource but can be unnerving when supplies get low.
