## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Twenty four percent of all Australian citizens were born in another country. This total is higher than many countries that are more famous immigrant destinations like the United States and Canada. Big boosts in immigration came after World War One and then again after the Second World War.

###2
In Southern Australia, the Nullarbor Plain is interesting for two reasons. First, it is the largest piece of limestone in the world at 77,000 square miles or 200,000 square kilometers. Second, this vast, barren environment is home to the longest stretch of single railway in the world measuring at 478 kilometers or just over 297 miles.

###3
Australian exports also provide interesting facts. One of the major items of export is wool. This industry is fueled by the 150 million sheep that inhabitant a continent that has only 22 million humans.

###4
As home to the world's largest reptile, the saltwater crocodile, the infamous poisonous stonefish and a predatory array of sharks, Australian waters can be very dangerous. However, there is one killer in the water that kills more humans than all of these threats combined and is barely even visible. The small and translucent box jellyfish has a toxic cocktail that it often can deliver before a swimmer even realizes that the creature was near.

###5
The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's largest organic structures at over 133,000 square miles or 344, 000 square kilometers. It is home to many endangered and non-endangered species of fish, birds and other sea creatures. As a huge tourist draw for the Australian economy, the Great Barrier Reef is a living, active underwater zoo.
