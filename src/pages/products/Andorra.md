## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Despite the fact that Andorra has some of the best family skiing in Europe, there is no airport. You have to get to Andorra by car from either Spain or France. Only the Vatican is a sovereign country smaller than Andorra.

###2
Andorra has the most unusual form of government in the world. It is the only country with two heads of state at the same time. Even stranger is the fact that neither head of state is a resident or citizen of Andorra. One of the co-heads of state is the person elected as the President of France. The other co-head of state is a Bishop of the Catholic Church appointed by the Pope.

###3
Andorra has never been at war with another country so they have enjoyed over 1,000 years of peace. The country has no national bank and until recently there were no taxes of any kind. Because there is no national bank, there is no national debt.

###4
Food and goods for citizens of Andorra come from other countries, except for one cash crop. Most of the land for agriculture grows quality tobacco. That crop and the fact no taxes are levied has meant tax-free cigarettes. This has been the reason for a large volume of tourists coming for duty free shopping since the end of World War II.

###5
Andorra is in the foothills of the Alps. Due to the elevations and clean air, many tourists who originally came for duty free shopping found great enjoyment in the natural environment of Andorra. This generated the development of excellent family ski facilities during winter. Hiking and camping are the big draw in the spring and summer months. The year around tourism has allowed Andorrans to enjoy almost constant 100% employment.
