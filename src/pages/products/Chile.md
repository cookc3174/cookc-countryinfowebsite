## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
East Island is part of Chile, despite being over 2,000 miles off the coast. This island is one of the great mysteries of the world, as nobody really knows how the settlers came to be on the island (there isn't any other body of land near the island), and nobody knows where they all went. All that is left are the famous Moai statues and some bird man cult carvings.

###2
The Real Robinson Crusoe crashed landed here. The smaller Robinson Crusoe island, is located just west of Santiago, and is the actual maroon site of the legendary individual. There is a large sculpture designed after his likeness in the middle of the island, and a few other interesting bits of information here. The island isn't a very large tourist draw, so it should be interesting to go and visit, while in the country of Chile.

###3
The public transportation system in Santiago is rather lacking. There is a public train that moves about areas of the city, but it shuts down while business hours are not running. This means, if you have a dinner date, or someplace to arrive to early in the morning, you are out of luck, as it does not run. You are able to take a taxi instead, but only use a metered taxi. Negotiating taxi rates almost never results in a cheaper drive.

###4
Chile is one of the safest countries in all of South America. It also has one of the best economically run plans in the country too.

###5
Chile is an excellent stopping point, if you plan on visiting Antarctica. The southern most tip is close enough for short range plans and boats to depart, allowing you to see the worlds most southern continent.
