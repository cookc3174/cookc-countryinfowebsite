## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Like cars and scooters, bicycles are required to have and display a license. Cycling is a popular mode of transportation on the islands and given the number of cyclists in the area and bicycle rental facilities, traffic laws and an ability to track every vehicle is necessary.

###2
Popular exports from the British Virgin Islands include fish, rum, fruits and vegetables and oddly enough, sand and gravel.

###3
Despite their consistently tropical weather, the British Virgin Islands have a tourist season that runs from December to May. This coincides with the consistently less-than-balmy weather in the United States and Europe, forcing people away from their winter blues.

###4
Tourism makes up for nearly half of the revenue for the British Virgin Islands, far surpassing any exports.

###5
The Ciboney Indians from the Americas were the first people to inhabit the British Virgin Islands. A century afterwards, the islands were colonized by the Arawak Indians, and then the Carib Indians from South America. A century after the colonization by the Carib Indians, Christopher Columbus discovered the islands and named them, according to legend, Las Once Mil Virgines.
