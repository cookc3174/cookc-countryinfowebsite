## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Belarus is a land of castles and fortifications. Its turbulent history of locals fighting off invaders and its own diverse cultural groups waging battles against each other left behind intriguing castles across its landscape, some from as early as the Middle Ages. Key sites are the Nesvizh Castle, built in the 13th century and greatly modified in 16th century; the Krevo Castle ruins, from the 14th century; and Mir Castle, dating back to the 16th century.

###2
It has historic cathedrals and churches from both Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions. Noteworthy are St. Sophia's Cathedral in Polotsk and the Monastery of Zhirovitchy in Minsk. Minority faiths are Jewish, Muslim and Protestant.

###3
It is home to the zoobr, also called the wisent. Related to the buffalo, it was nearly extinct but the surviving animals were bred and the species rescued. Many live at the wildlife refuge at Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park.

###4
One of its most famous native sons was painter Marc Chagall, who was born in 1887 in Vitebsk. The early modernist artist escaped the Holocaust and fled to the U.S. His surrealistic works are celebrated at the Marc Chagall Museum in Vitebsk.

###5
It was attacked by the Nazis and has many World War II memorials. At Brest Fortress, soldiers furiously fought off the Germans. The soldiers did not surrender, but were eventually overpowered. Belarus today honors those who defended the fortress against the Nazis for so long before being killed or captured.
