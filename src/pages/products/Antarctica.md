## 5 Facts You Might Not Know

###1
Eleven per cent of the land that is part of the continent of Antarctica is composed of floating ice shelves. Two countries in the Northern Hemisphere also have ice shelves and they are Greenland and Canada. These shelves form when ice piled on mountains and terrain slides down the coast and into the water.

###2
The weather is extreme with high winds and normal temperatures between -40 and -90 degrees Fahrenheit. The lowest recorded temperature reached nearly to -130 degrees Fahrenheit. Then because the continent has little rainfall, Antarctica is considered a desert.

###3
Flora and fauna do live on the continent, surviving the harsh climate. The most well-known and loved animals are the penguins and seals, of course. Microscopic animals are more prevalent such as nematodes and Tardigrades with their plump bodies and four pairs of legs. Fungi and bacteria live on Antarctica and the tundra provides the only vegetation.

###4
Captain James Cook and his expedition ships are the first Europeans in recorded history to cross the Antarctic Circle. The year was 1773 in January. He made two more trips, one in December and another a month later, in January of 1774. Still, the first recorded landing on the continent was a seal hunter named John Davis. He landed on the western side in February of 1821.

###5
Churches have been established on the Antarctic such as Catholic, one non-denominational Christian, one Bulgarian Orthodox and one Russian Orthodox. The continent has up to 5,000 temporary residents in the summer, mainly researchers and explorers. Wintertime sees smaller crowds of around 1,000 researchers.
